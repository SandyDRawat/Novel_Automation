# Novel Scraper and EPUB Compiler

This project is a Python-based tool for scraping novel chapters from the web and compiling them into an EPUB file. If the content is in Chinese, the tool can translate it into English before compilation. The application leverages BeautifulSoup for web scraping, Ebooklib for EPUB creation, and an optional translation tool using a Hugging Face LLM model (Rawsand/opus-mt-zh-en-finetuned-zh-to-en). This model is based on the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-zh-en base model and is fine-tuned on a custom dataset of translated novels for content translation.

- **EPUB Compilation**: Compiles scraped chapters into a structured EPUB file, complete with a table of contents and styling.
- **Content Translation**: Translates Chinese text to English for accessibility to a wider audience.
- **Customizable**: Supports customization for different websites by modifying scraping logic.

## Usage

### Running the Scraper

- If default websites have the content you desire then just run `app.py` file and give the inputs and you can download the desired files:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
- Else
1.  Open the `app.py` file and update the following:

    -   `base_url`: Base URL of the website.

2.  Open the `web_crawler.py` file and update the tags to reterieve the contents as per you target website namely:

    -  Then content element tag
    -  chapter title tag
    -  Next chapter link tag
    -  Also check if the url in next chapter link element is relative( not starts with http://websitename.com) or not. and if not remove it from next chapter link method as also mentionded in the comments there.

3.  Then run `app.py` script which will:

    -   Start a local hosted streamlit app dashboard.
    -   Fill the necessary input feilds.
    -   Use Translate checkbox if translating content to English (from Chinese) is needed.
    -   Wait as translation takes time and then download the epub file.
